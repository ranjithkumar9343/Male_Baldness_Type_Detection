# Male_baldness_type_detection
This project classifies male baldness stages 3 to 7 using YOLOv8 and Sequential CNN models, based on the Hamilton-Norwood scale. Due to limited data, stages 1 and 2 were excluded. The results show that the YOLOv8 model outperforms the Sequential CNN in accuracy and overall performance.
## Features
- Image processing for feature extraction.
- Classification of baldness stages with high accuracy.
- User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV for image processing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning

## Project Highlights
- Trained on a custom dataset of images.
- Achieved reliable stage detection accuracy.
- Led a team and managed dataset preparation and model optimization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the main Python script to test the model.
3. Input an image to classify its baldness stage.
